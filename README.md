============

Generic Postfix setup using vmail and /var/mail/virtual dirs and sasl auth

This includes configuration options to centralize the mail dirs, multiple,
virtual domains, and it is easy to encrypt with ecryptfs mount, and paired well with dovecot.  
The authentication scheme is shadow, so no additional auth tools are necessary.
